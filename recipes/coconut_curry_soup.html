  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Very filling and even a little zesty, this butternut squash soup is a
    decadent appetizer. Butternut squash is hearty on its own, but the coconut
    milk makes the mixture truly rich. Serve with a warm baguette.

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>butternut squash, halved and seeded</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, divided</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped yellow onion</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon yellow curry powder</li>
    <li>1 (13 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>

    <li>
      Place butternut squash in a baking dish, flesh side up. Brush 1
      tablespoon melted butter over the flesh and top with 1/2 teaspoon salt,
      1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, and cayenne pepper.
    </li>
    <li>
      Roast in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour. Remove squash
      from oven and cool for 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place a large stockpot over medium heat; add 1 tablespoon butter. Cook
      and stir onion in the melted butter for 2 minutes. Add curry powder;
      cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in coconut milk; bring to a boil.
    </li>
    <li>
      Scoop flesh from the butternut squash and add to coconut milk mixture;
      mix in remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice,
      vegetable stock, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Bring to a boil, reduce heat
      to low, and simmer until soup is heated through.
    </li>
    <li>
      Blend soup using an immersion blender on low speed. Simmer until soup is
      smooth and thickened, about 20 minutes more. Add more vegetable stock
      for a thinner consistency and season with salt.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ladle soup into bowls and top each with pumpkin seeds and a pinch of
      nutmeg.
    </li>
  </ol>
