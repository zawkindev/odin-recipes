  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>3 pounds baking potatoes</li>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>Â½ cup chopped onion</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans</li>
    <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning mix</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prick potatoes with a
      fork. Transfer to a 10x15-inch baking pan.
    </li>

    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until tender, about 1 hour.
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, for chili, add ground beef, onion, and garlic to a large
      saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring to break up lumps, until meat
      is browned and onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain grease.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add tomato sauce, chili beans, and chili seasoning mix to saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and
      simmer, covered, at least 10 minutes to let flavors meld.
    </li>
    <li>
      When potatoes are cool enough to handle, use a spoon to scoop potato pulp into large bowl. (You should have about
      4 cups pulp). Discard skins. Add broth to bowl. Mash potatoes until smooth.
    </li>
    <li>
      Melt butter in a 4- to 5-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook, whisking constantly to make a
      light roux, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk, 1 cup at a time. Cook, whisking constantly, until lightly
      thickened. Stir in potato mixture, buttermilk, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until heated through,
      3 to 5 minutes (soup will be very thick). Remove from heat and gradually stir in 1 cup cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Divide soup among bowls. Top with chili, sour cream, remaining 1/2 cup cheese, and chives (if using).
    </li>
  </ol>
